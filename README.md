# `eslint-plugin-react-hooks-configurable`

Fork of `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` that allow a bit more configuration than the original plugin.

The configurable part was originally made by Stephen Sugden (@grncdr) (you can see his [package on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@grncdr/eslint-plugin-react-hooks)).  
The difference with this version is that this one uses the same numbering as the official version for an 
easy replacement (in one way or the other), the source are publicly accessible, it contains some documentation (see below :)) and, 
at the time of writing anyway, it is synchronized with the original version and solves compatibility issues with ESLint.
